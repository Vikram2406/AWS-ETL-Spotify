# Spotify ETL Symphony: Harmonizing Data Flow on AWS

!["C:\Users\vikra\Desktop\AWS Spotify.webp"](Projectlogo.png)

## Overview

Spotify ETL Symphony is a sophisticated data engineering project aimed at orchestrating Spotify's diverse datasets of albums, artists, and tracks within the AWS cloud ecosystem. This project implements an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, seamlessly processing data, transforming it into structured insights, and loading it into various AWS services for analysis.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Utilizes AWS IAM roles for secure access to data sources and extracts rich datasets of albums, artists, and tracks from internal sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Leverages AWS Glue for data transformation, ensuring consistency and quality. Automated transformation processes are implemented using Glue Crawlers, and datasets are structured and enriched within Amazon S3 buckets.
- **Data Loading**: Utilizes AWS Athena for querying and analysis, facilitating efficient data retrieval. Curated datasets are loaded into Athena for in-depth exploration.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Unearths compelling insights, including trends in album releases across different genres and time periods, analysis of popular artists and their impact on listener engagement, and exploration of track popularity trends and user preferences.
- **Visualization**: Employs Amazon QuickSight to create dynamic visualizations and dashboards, offering stakeholders intuitive insights.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Spotify ETL Symphony project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-etl-symphony.git
   ```

2. **Set Up AWS Environment**: Set up your AWS environment, including IAM roles, S3 buckets, AWS Glue, Athena, and QuickSight, according to the project requirements.

3. **Run the ETL Pipeline**: Execute the ETL pipeline by running the provided scripts or AWS Glue jobs, ensuring data extraction, transformation, and loading are performed seamlessly.

4. **Analyze and Visualize Data**: Utilize AWS Athena and Amazon QuickSight to query, analyze, and visualize the curated datasets, uncovering valuable insights and trends.
